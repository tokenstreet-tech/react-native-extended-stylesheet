This package is a fork of the [React Native Extended StyleSheet](https://github.com/vitalets/react-native-extended-stylesheet) by [Vitaliy Potapov](https://github.com/vitalets). He describes the package as follows:

> Drop-in replacement of [React Native StyleSheet](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/stylesheet.html) with media-queries, variables, dynamic themes, relative units, percents, math operations, scaling and other styling stuff.

## Key differences between this fork and the original are:

-   IntelliSense IDE integration ([CSS intellisense not working #118](https://github.com/vitalets/react-native-extended-stylesheet/issues/118))
-   Maintained ([Is this repo active? #154](https://github.com/vitalets/react-native-extended-stylesheet/issues/154))
-   Latest dependencies - Secured by Dependabot
-   Published as CommonJS & ESmodules (powered by [react-native-builder-bob](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-builder-bob))
-   Strong type declarations are included in this package ((Entire codebase has been migrated to TypeScript)[https://github.com/tokenstreet-tech/react-native-extended-stylesheet/releases/tag/v0.14.0])
